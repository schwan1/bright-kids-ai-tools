# Text in Images - Quick Reference

## 🎯 What This Does

The AI now **draws text directly into the images** as part of the illustration, just like professional children's books (e.g., "Eric and Max, the Brave Teddy Bear").

## ✨ Key Features

### Cover Pages
- **Title text** drawn at bottom of cover
- **Style-matched typography** (watercolor = hand-lettered, comic = bold caps, etc.)
- **Artistic integration** - text looks painted/drawn, not overlaid

### Story Pages  
- **Narration text** drawn at bottom of each page
- **Background text box** for readability
- **2-3 lines maximum** with automatic formatting
- **Style consistency** throughout book

## 🎨 Text Styles by Illustration Type

| Style | Text Appearance | Example |
|-------|----------------|---------|
| **Watercolor** | Hand-lettered, flowing, painted look | *Emma's Adventure* |
| **2D Digital** | Clean, bold, modern sans-serif | **Emma's Adventure** |
| **Comic** | **BOLD UPPERCASE IMPACT** | **EMMA'S ADVENTURE!** |
| **3D Modern** | Smooth, dimensional, polished | **Emma's Adventure** |

## 📝 How AI Receives Instructions

### For Covers:
```
"Draw the title text 'Emma's Starry Adventure' at bottom third
- Hand-lettered font for watercolor style
- Warm amber/brown colors
- Subtle glow around letters
- Decorative flourishes"
```

### For Pages:
```
"Include this text at bottom: 'Emma felt brave...'
- Storybook font with soft appearance
- Cream text box with soft edges
- 2-3 lines, centered

```
