- Loading state during generation

### Troubleshooting

**Problem: "Generate cover" button is disabled**
- Solution: Make sure you've uploaded a reference photo and generated a story first

**Problem: Cover generation fails**
- Check browser console for error messages
- Verify OpenAI API key is configured
- Ensure avatar was successfully generated
- Try regenerating the avatar if it seems corrupted

**Problem: Cover doesn't match the style**
- Try regenerating the cover (click "Regenerate cover")
- Verify the correct style is selected in the style picker
- Check that avatar was generated with the current style

**Problem: Character looks different on cover vs. story pages**
- This can happen due to AI variance
- Try regenerating the cover
- Ensure you're using the same illustration style throughout

### API Endpoint Tests

Test the cover API directly (requires avatar base64):

```bash
# Test validation (should return error)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/storybook/cover \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'

# Expected: {"error":"Title and child name are required"}
```
