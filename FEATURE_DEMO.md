## Character Consistency

### How It Works

**Avatar → Cover → Story Pages**

```
Reference Photo
     ↓
  Avatar           (Character established)
     ↓
  Cover Page       (Same character in magical scene)
     ↓
  Story Pages      (Same character in story scenes)
```

**Visual Consistency Elements:**
- Hair color and style ✓
- Skin tone ✓
- Facial features ✓
- Clothing/accessories ✓
- Overall proportions ✓

## Real-World Use Case

**Parent creates storybook for Emma (age 5) about starting school:**

1. **Upload Emma's photo** → System creates watercolor-style avatar
2. **Enter info**: Name: Emma, Challenge: "First day jitters"
3. **Generate story** → "Emma's Big School Adventure"
4. **Generate cover** → Beautiful cover showing Emma as a brave explorer with school elements (backpack, books, friends) in magical watercolor style
5. **Illustrate pages** → 10 pages showing Emma's school journey
6. **Export PDF** → Complete storybook ready to print or share digitally!

**Result**: Professional-looking personalized children's book with Emma as the star! 🌟

## Tips for Best Results

### For Cover Generation:

1. **Use clear, well-lit photos** for the reference image
2. **Choose a consistent style** before generating avatar and cover
3. **Write engaging titles** that inspire magical scenes
4. **Regenerate if needed** - AI can produce variations
5. **Generate cover after story** to ensure title is available

### Troubleshooting:

❌ **Problem**: Cover doesn't look magical enough
✅ **Solution**: Click "Regenerate cover" for a new variation

❌ **Problem**: Character looks different from avatar  
✅ **Solution**: Ensure avatar was generated with current style

❌ **Problem**: Cover is too dark/bright
✅ **Solution**: Try regenerating or choosing different style
