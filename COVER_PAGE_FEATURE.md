# Cover Page Feature Implementation

## Overview
Added a new cover page feature to the storybook application that creates a fun, professional children's book cover illustration featuring the child's avatar and the story title.

## Changes Made

### 1. New API Route: `/app/api/storybook/cover/route.js`
- **Purpose**: Generate a whimsical storybook cover image
- **Input**: Title, child name, avatar image (base64), and illustration style
- **Output**: Cover image (base64) with dimensions 1024x1536 (same as story pages)
- **Features**:
  - Uses the avatar as the source to maintain character consistency
  - Creates a magical, inviting storybook scene
  - Includes decorative elements (sparkles, swirls, borders)
  - Maintains the selected illustration style
  - No text/watermarks in the generated image

### 2. Frontend Updates: `/app/storybook/page.js`

#### State Management
- Added `coverImage` state to store the generated cover
- Updated cleanup useEffect to include cover image

#### New Function: `generateCover()`
- Generates cover page using the story title and avatar
- Calls the new cover API endpoint
- Displays loading state and error handling
- Stores result as data URL

#### UI Enhancements
- **Cover Page Section**: Added a dedicated section above story pages with:
  - Border highlighting (2px solid with accent color)
  - Cover image display area (300px min height)
  - Title and dedication preview
  - Generate/Regenerate button
  - Visual indicators when avatar is missing
  - Disabled state when avatar or story not ready

#### Export Updates
- **PDF Export**: 
  - Now includes illustrated cover as the first page
  - Cover scales to fit nicely with margins
  - Title and dedication displayed below the cover illustration
  - Falls back to simple title page if no cover generated
  
- **Image Export**:
  - Cover included as `00-cover.png` (first in sequence)
  - All page images numbered sequentially after cover
  - Updated button enable/disable logic to account for cover

## User Workflow

1. **Upload Reference Photo**: Child's photo for avatar generation
2. **Select Style**: Choose illustration style (updates avatar automatically)
3. **Draft Story**: Generate story text
4. **Generate Cover**: Click "Generate cover" button (requires avatar + story)
5. **Illustrate Pages**: Generate illustrations for story pages
6. **Export**: PDF and image exports automatically include the cover

## Technical Details

### Image Dimensions
- All images (cover + story pages): **1024x1536 pixels** (2:3 aspect ratio)
- Consistent with OpenAI's image generation API
- Perfect for children's book format

### Character Consistency
- Cover uses the avatar as source image
- Ensures the same character appears on cover and throughout the story
- Style consistency maintained via prompt engineering

### API Integration
- Uses OpenAI's `gpt-image-1` model with image editing endpoint
- Processes avatar and style to create cover scene
- Handles both JSON and binary responses from API
